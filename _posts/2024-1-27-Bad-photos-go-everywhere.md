Some time ago, I made a post on [contributing to the Internet public good game](https://giuseppevizzari.github.io/posts/2023/11/Contributing/). I want to follow up with a couple curious trajectories of photos I took and shared on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/users/gvizzari0-1141607/).

Here is a photo I took over ten years ago in Wuppertal, with my [Pentax K7](https://www.pentaxforums.com/camerareviews/pentax-k-7.html) in particular it depicts the Wuppertaler Schwebebahn (Wuppertal's Suspension Railway):

By using a well known image search engine that does not need any additional advertisement, I found it has been used quite a bit, in several websites. In particular, it has been used by a [marketing agency based in Wuppertal](https://www.talcompany.de/), by a [company selling defective (euro) pallets for the North Rhine Westphalia area](https://www.europalette.de/wuppertal.html), by a [job advertisement company specialized in pharmacists](https://www.deutscher-apotheker-service.de/stellenangebote/pta/pta-wuppertal-b-1555) for a specific job offer in Wuppertal, by a [German private banking magazine](https://www.private-banking-magazin.de/thema-berufsbild-berater/?page=11) - and in [more than one page](https://www.private-banking-magazin.de/stadtsparkasse-wuppertal-sucht-portfolioberater-fuer-die-individuelle/), by an [Italian online magazine](https://fivmagazine.it/affittare-comprare-vivere-a-wuppertal-condominio-o-casa-familiare-intervista-allagente-immobiliare/) in a page devoted to rent or buy an apartment or house in Wuppertal... and probably many more. If I'm not mistaken, none of these site has acknowledged me or Pixabay as a source of the photo.

It is not an isolated case. Here is a photo of Ciclamino taken with my [Pentax K3](https://www.pentaxforums.com/camerareviews/pentax-k-3.html). Ciclamino is one of my cats (by the way, I'm really envious of cats' ability to relax). Well here it is:

Again, I tracked down several websites using this photo. The [website of a Polish company](https://www.robirobi.com/blog/) offering services and appliances for cat owners - and in [more than one page](https://www.robirobi.com/dobry-drapak-dla-kota-czyli-jaki/), the [web site of a Japanese shop](https://nigaoe-pets.com/blogs/magazine/cat-tower-one) for pet related objects, different web sites of a similar Dutch shops ([here](https://jebestekeuze.nl/category/dieren/) and [here](https://huisdierenreviews.nl/beste-krabpaal/)... I think you got the picture, there's no need to go on, even if I could.

On one hand, I'm glad that someone is implicitly appreciating some photos I took, although I know that there is a Giuseppe Vizzari that is a really good photographer, but [it's not me](https://vizzeppe.wixsite.com/giuseppevizzari/home), despite the homonymy!

The point is that it takes very little to acknowledge the work and contribution of someone else on the Internet: a classic example is a workshop website. I co-organized quite a number of workshops in the past few years, for instance the [AIxIA 2020 Discussion Papers workshop](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/aixia2020-dp/) in which I credit [the author of a photo I use](https://www.flickr.com/photos/141324643@N05/49877093938) as banner.

Some of the authors of these creative works could be freelance artists making a living out of this kind of activity, so at least a minimum of visibility is really due, especially from businesses that might even make a profit, partly also because of the creative works of these authors. So, besides contributing to the public goods game, __be fair, give credit where it is due__.
