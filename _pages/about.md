Hi, I'm Giuseppe Vizzari, associate professor at the [Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication](https://www.disco.unimib.it/) of the [University of Milano-Bicocca](https://www.unimib.it/).

I'm currently Coordinator of the master's degree in [Theory and Technology of Communication (TTC)](https://en.unimib.it/graduate/theory-technology-communication), a joint effort with the [Department of Psychology](https://psicologia.unimib.it/en). A basic description of the course is available in English, but it is mostly in Italian, more information can be found in Italian in a dedicated website in [TTC's University's Moodle](https://elearning.unimib.it/course/index.php?categoryid=3514)).

I'm currently leader of a Work Package within Spoke 8 (Mobility as a Service) of the NextGenerationEu funded [National Center for Sustainable Mobility (MOST)](https://www.centronazionalemost.it/). This is the front page of my personal website in which you can find some information about me (and links to other web sites / services that conveniently automatically offer information about me), some current and past activity I want to highlight.

More on my profile and research activities in the [CV section](cv/).

Credits: the web site is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose. It supports a lot of things, I use a very small portion of what it offers, and I'll probably never have the time to do more...
