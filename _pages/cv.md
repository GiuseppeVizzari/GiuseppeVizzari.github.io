## Career
Giuseppe Vizzari is Associate Professor (since October 2015) and member of the [Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication](https://www.disco.unimib.it/en) ([University of Milano-Bicocca](https://en.unimib.it/), Milan, Italy). He has a Degree in Computer Science, from the University of Milan, and a PhD in Computer Science from University of Milano-Bicocca. He has been a fellow of the [Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/), spending a research period between the months of July and August 2011 at the [Research Center on Advanced Science and Technology](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) of The University of Tokyo. From October 2018 to September 2024 he was president of the master's degree course on [Theory and Technology of Communication](https://en.unimib.it/graduate/theory-technology-communication), an interdisciplinary course coming from the collaboration of the Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication and the [Department of Psychology](https://psicologia.unimib.it/en) of the University of Milano-Bicocca.

## Research Activity
His research activities mainly concern __agent based models and technologies__ (situated agent models and applications, environments for multi-agent systems, agent-based modelling and simulation of complex systems, with particular attention to crowds of pedestrians and traffic systems), __knowledge based systems__ (case-based reasoning and semantic web applications), artificial intelligence and computer vision applications to the analysis of __complex and collective phenomena__ (in particular, crowds of pedestrians). His researches are strongly characterized by an __interdisciplinary nature__, which implied the collaboration with researchers in the fields of civil and transportation engineering, psychology, social sciences, biology, archaeology and humanities in general, and more recently astrophysics.

## Research Projects
He is leader of the WP4 - Data integration, analysis, security, and delivery of the Spoke 8 - Mobility-as-a-Service in the NextGenerationEu funded [National Center for Sustainable Mobility (MOST)](https://www.centronazionalemost.it/). He was is responsible for the Research Unit of the University of Milano-Bicocca within the [NEANIAS project (Novel EOSC services for Emerging Atmosphere, Underwater and Space Challenges, 2019 - 2021)](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/863448), funded by the EC in the call H2020-INFRAEOSC-2018-2020. He has led the modeling and simulation activities of the Crystals project (2010-2011), funded by the Centre of Research Excellence in Hajj and Omrah of the Umm Al-Qura University (Makkah, Saudi Arabia) and in collaboration with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the University of Tokyo (Japan). He was responsible for the activities of knowledge modeling, definition of ontologies for the organization of digital contents related to local Cultural-Heritage in the TIVAL (Integrated Technologies for the Valorization of Cultural Heritage) project (2010-2012), funded by Regione Lombardia, carried out in collaboration with Politecnico di Milano, University of Pavia, University of Milano. Earlier he collaborated with the FIRB Project MAIS (Multichannel Adaptive Information Systems Multichannel Adaptive Information Systems)(2002-2005), and with the P-TRUCK project (2002-2004), funded by Pirelli Tyres.

## Supervision of young researchers
He has supervised two PhD students at the University of Milano-Bicocca ([Luca Crociani](https://it.linkedin.com/in/luca-crociani-149045183/en) and [Sultan Daud Khan](https://nutech.edu.pk/academics/education-learning/nutech-school-of-information-technology/computer-science/faculty-cs/dr-sultan-daud-khan/) - XXVIII cycle). He supervised a visiting PhD student from the Federal University of Uberlândia, Uberlândia, Brazil [(Claudiney Tinoco](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=h7Aucq4AAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao)), from December 2019 to August 2020. He has supervised a visiting PhD student from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei ([Yiping Zeng](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57193553660)), for one year from October 2016 to October 2017, supported by the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China. He has supervised a visiting master student from Beijing University of Technology ([Zhao Pengfei](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pengfei-Zhao-18)) between October and December 2015, supported by a scholarship by the same University. He supervised a placement of [José Miguel Pinazo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josemiguelpinazo/?locale=en_US) (AINIA, Spain) for four months between October 2009 and January 2010. He is member of the board of the PhD course in Computer Science since 2014 and he was vice coordinator between October 2015 and January 2017. He co-chaired a PhD school on “The Complexity of Crowd Dynamics: analysis, modeling, simulation” in 2014, and he held seminars and courses in several PhD schools: in particular, he held a tutorial “Agent-Based Modeling for the Simulation of Complex Systems”, in the context of the 11th European Agent Systems Summer School (EASSS’09), University of Torino, Italy.
